# CodeBase Sandbox Tests

## Description

This is a repository for holding small projects with base code for common development tasks. The projects are used as playground to run AI development assistant tests. It is a part of AI/RUN <sup>TM</sup> Engineering Benchmark. See more details in [AI/RUN <sup>TM</sup> Engineering Benchmark repo](https://github.com/epam/AIRUN-Engineering-Benchmark)  to understand the whole picture on what the benchmark is and what repositories are involved.

It is supposed that each project contains a boilerplate code required to run one test described elsewhere.
